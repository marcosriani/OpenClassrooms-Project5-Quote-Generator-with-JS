# OpenClassrooms - Project 5 Quote Generator with JS
Create a quotation generator

Step 1: Random quotes

The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

Step 2: More customized quotes

Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
